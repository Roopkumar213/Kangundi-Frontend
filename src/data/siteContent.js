  overviewText:
    "Kangundhi emerged as a significant settlement in 1066 AD under Zamindar administration, a system that shaped the village until 1950. The village’s defining landmark—an 11th-century hilltop fort—served as both a defensive stronghold and an administrative center.",

  narrative: [
    "The Kangundi Fort represents one of the region’s most historically significant medieval structures. Built during the 11th century, the fort utilized the natural advantage of elevated rocky terrain, with stone fortifications that remain partially intact today.",
    "The hilltop Shiva temple, reached by a traditional footpath from the village, continues to anchor Kangundhi’s spiritual identity. The annual Maha Shivratri festival draws devotees for night-long prayers, preserving centuries-old traditions.",
    "Located just 11–16 km from Kuppam, Kangundhi sits along a historic cultural corridor between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Its dramatic landscape of rocky hills and valleys is now drawing interest from trekkers and adventure enthusiasts."
